# DOS_Listing_255_filenames
Avoid apps errors when path lenght is longer 255 characters.  Try this Windows command with "gawk" and list the longest files/folders

This command can be used directly from Windows command prompt. 
1. Install GNU gawk tool from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/
2. Edit your Windows PATH variable, add the gawk command path to it 
3. Open command prompt and run the .bat or copy the command and paste it on the prompt

Cheers !
